	<h1> Nice to meet you! </h1>
	
	<p> Originally from Saigon, Vietnam, Ryan Nguyen moved to Fort Worth, Texas at the age of eleven. He became fluent in both Vietnamese and English. Ryan developed an early interest in graphic design and photography. By the age of twelve he taught himself Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator through online tutorials. His works have received many awards, as well as multiple features in local magazines throughout high school. </p>

	<p> He graduated from the All Saints' Episcopal School in Fort Worth, Texas and is currently attending the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence. He is pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in graphic design (class of 2019). When he isn't painting or taking pictures, he can be found tumbling down the icy slopes of Colorado while snowboarding, or binge watching comedy sitcoms on Netflix.</p>
